Application control may be able to prevent the running of executables masquerading as other files.

If a link is being visited by a user, network intrusion prevention systems and systems designed to scan and remove malicious downloads can be used to block activity.

T1204-M1021
If a link is being visited by a user, block unknown or unused files in transit by default that should not be downloaded or by policy from suspicious sites as a best practice to prevent some vectors, such as .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl, etc. Some download scanning devices can open and analyze compressed and encrypted formats, such as zip and rar that may be used to conceal malicious files.

Common tools for detecting Linux rootkits include: rkhunter , chrootkit , although rootkits may be designed to evade certain detection tools.

T1547.006-M1038
Application control and software restriction tools, such as SELinux, KSPP, grsecurity MODHARDEN, and Linux kernel tuning can aid in restricting kernel module loading. Since macOS High Sierra 10.13, Secure Kernel Extension Loading (SKEL) can also be used to restrict the loading of kernel modules.

T1547.006-M1026
Limit access to the root account and prevent users from loading kernel modules and extensions through proper privilege separation and limiting Privilege Escalation opportunities.

T1112-M1024
Ensure proper permissions are set for Registry hives to prevent users from modifying keys for system components that may lead to privilege escalation.
